## Tools to Know for Drupal Development <a id="tools-to-know-for-drupal-development"></a>

### **Drupal Coding Standards**

An overview of coding best practices and standards as they are applied in the Drupal community can be found [here](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards):

[https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards)

These coding standards, detailed for every area in which code might be produced during Drupal development, represent the broadly established best practices of the community. Adhering to these best practices will make development go more smoothly, and your contributions to Drupal core or modules to be more readily and easily accepted. If you are working on a project with Acquia technical support, these are the coding standards to which pull requests must adhere.

### Drush

Drush is considered a basic skill for Drupal site development.

## **Practice Skills Application**

The application of Drupal 8 concepts is the hands-on practice development. The courses provide some opportunities to practice doing basic front-end development tasks alongside the videos, but you will need more practice than that to pass the exam. Some suggested resources are below, which provide details for the completion of specific front-end development tasks in Drupal 8.
